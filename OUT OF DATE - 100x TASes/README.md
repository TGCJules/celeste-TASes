100x / Teleport Mode TASes

UPDATE 04/04/2023: Do NOT use the 100x files, as they are out of date. Instead use more optimised ones at EuniverseCat's repo at https://github.com/EuniverseCat/miscCelesteTAS/tree/master/teleport%20mode

Regarding the 100x Dash Speed TASes:
The 100x TASes were specifically TASed so that they work in Celeste version 1.4.0.0 and not rely on legacy dash behaviour. I understand the Euni
has already published several 100x Dash Speed TASes (under the name "Teleport Mode", which is a slightly incorrect name and I will only be calling it
100x Dash speed) but for those TAS files to be able to function, legacy dash behaviour must be used.

To get the 100x Dash Speed TASes to work:
- Have the Extended Variant Mode mod installed
- Under movement, change 'Dash speed' to 100x.
- IMPORTANT: Makes sure that Legacy Dash Speed Behaviour is turned OFF. I'm not sure whether it breaks any of these TASes but they were TASed without it
and it may break, it might not so whatever
